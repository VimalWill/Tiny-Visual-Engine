## Tiny Visual Engine 

A part of Autonomous car powered by "Deep Reinforcement Learning Model" and the engine supported by YoLoP. The model trained in the 
simulated environment called Carla and tested in the real-time. 

### Hardware & Model Deployment 
AI model dynamically quantized for INT8 and deployed onto NVIDIA's Jetson Nano version. Eventhough the visual preception subsystem can 
work on resource-constrained system, yet the DQL model's performance is not up to the level
